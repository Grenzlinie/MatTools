As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `symmetry_equivalence`: Checks if two vacancy defects are symmetry equivalent. Format: bool.
    - `vacancy_string_representation`: String representation of the vacancy defect, indicating the element and site index. Format: str.
    - `vacancy_oxidation_state`: Oxidation state of the vacancy defect. Format: int.
    - `vacancy_charge_states`: Possible charge states for the vacancy defect. Format: list.
    - `vacancy_multiplicity`: Multiplicity of the vacancy defect, indicating the number of symmetry-equivalent sites. Format: int.
    - `vacancy_supercell_formula`: Chemical formula of the supercell structure containing the vacancy defect. Format: str.
    - `vacancy_name`: Name of the vacancy defect, typically indicating the element involved. Format: str.
    - `vacancy_self_equivalence`: Checks if the vacancy defect is equivalent to itself. Format: bool.
    - `vacancy_element_changes`: Changes in the number of elements due to the vacancy defect. Format: dict.
    - `vacancy_latex_name`: LaTeX formatted name of the vacancy defect. Format: str.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/GaN.vasp`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.core import Structure
    gan_struct = Structure.from_file(file_path / "GaN.vasp")
    ```
    - Generate vacancy defects using Pymatgen:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.core import Vacancy
    s = gan_struct.copy()
    vac = Vacancy(s, s.sites[0])
    vac2 = Vacancy(s, s.sites[1])
    ```

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generate data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.core import Structure`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
