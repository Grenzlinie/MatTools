As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `element_changes`: Represents the change in the number of atoms of each element due to the defect. Format: dict.
    - `defect_string_representation`: String representation of the NamedDefect nd0. Format: str.
    - `defect_inequality`: Generates a defect in a GaN material where one gallium atom is absent. Then checks if it is not the same as nd0. Format: bool.
    - `defect_equality`: Uses NamedDefect to generate a NamedDefect object nd2, and nd2 needs to be the same as nd0. Check if nd2 is the same as nd0. Format: bool.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the bulk structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/Mg_Ga/bulk_sc/CONTCAR.gz`.
    - Access the defect structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/Mg_Ga/q=0/CONTCAR.gz`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function ```python\nfrom pymatgen.core import Structure\nbulk_struct = Structure.from_file(bulk_dir / "CONTCAR.gz")\ndefect_struct = Structure.from_file(defect_dir / "CONTCAR.gz")\n``` to read the structure data.
    - Generate NamedDefect objects using the Pymatgen function: ```python\nfrom pymatgen.analysis.defects.core import NamedDefect\nnd0 = NamedDefect.from_structures(defect_structure=defect_struct, bulk_structure=bulk_struct)\n```.

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generate data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.core import Structure`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
