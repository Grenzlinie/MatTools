As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `number_of_defects_with_chgcar`: The total number of native defects generated when using a CHGCAR file as input. The format is an integer.
    - `number_of_defects_with_structure`: The total number of native defects generated when using a structure object as input. The format is an integer.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the CHGCAR file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function ```python\nfrom pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Chgcar\nchgcar = Chgcar.from_file(file_path / "CHGCAR.Fe3O4.vasp")\n``` to read the CHGCAR data.
    - Use the Pymatgen function ```python\nstructure = chgcar.structure\n``` to read the structure data.
    - Tip: Both of these properties are calculated using the same pymatgen function, with only CHGCAR file or structural object as input parameter.

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generate data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Chgcar`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
