As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `dummy_sites_count`: The number of dummy sites with species X in the structure after topography analysis. The format is an integer.
    - `value_error_check`: Ensures that a ValueError is raised when the TopographyAnalyzer is initialized with conflicting species lists. The format is a boolean indicating whether the error is raised.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the CHGCAR file path for Fe3O4 at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function 
    ```python
    from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Chgcar
    chgcar_fe3o4 = Chgcar.from_file(file_path / "CHGCAR.Fe3O4.vasp")
    ``` to read the charge density data.
    - Use the Pymatgen function
    ```python
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.utils import [MASK]
    struct = chgcar_fe3o4.structure
    ta = [MASK](struct, ["Fe", "O"], [], check_volume=True)
    node_struct = ta.get_structure_with_nodes()
    # All sites with species X
    dummy_sites = [site for site in node_struct if site.specie.[MASK] == "X"]
    dummy_sites_count = len(dummy_sites)
    value_error_check = False
    try:
        ta = [MASK](struct, ["O"], ["Fe"], check_volume=True)
    except ValueError:
        value_error_check = True
    ``` to get results. Replace [MASK] with the correct pymatgen functions to make the code run correctly.

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generates data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Chgcar`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
