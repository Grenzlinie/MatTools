As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `defect_name_consistency`: Ensures that all defect entries in a group have the same defect name, indicating consistent grouping of defects. The format is a boolean.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/GaN.vasp`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.core import Structure
    gan_struct = Structure.from_file(file_path / "GaN.vasp")
    ```
    - Access the defect entries and plot data for Mg_Ga from the directory path: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/Mg_Ga`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function:
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    from collections import defaultdict
    from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Vasprun, Locpot
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.thermo import DefectEntry, group_defect_entries
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.core import Substitution, PeriodicSite
    from pymatgen.core.periodic_table import Specie

    def load_defect_entries_and_plot_data(test_dir):
        data = defaultdict(dict)
        for fold in test_dir.glob("./*"):
            if not fold.is_dir():
                continue
            data[fold.name] = {
                "vasprun": Vasprun(fold / "vasprun.xml.gz"),
                "locpot": Locpot.from_file(fold / "LOCPOT.gz"),
            }
        bulk_locpot = data["bulk_sc"]["locpot"]
        defect_entries = dict()
        plot_data = dict()
        for qq in [-2, -1, 0, 1]:
            computed_entry = data[f"q={qq}"]["vasprun"].get_computed_entry(inc_structure=True)
            defect_locpot = data[f"q={qq}"]["locpot"]
            ga_site = gan_struct[0]
            mg_site = PeriodicSite(Specie("Mg"), ga_site.frac_coords, gan_struct.lattice)
            defect_Mg_Ga = Substitution(gan_struct, mg_site)
            def_entry = DefectEntry(defect=defect_Mg_Ga, charge_state=qq, sc_entry=computed_entry)
            frey_summary = def_entry.get_freysoldt_correction(defect_locpot=defect_locpot, bulk_locpot=bulk_locpot, dielectric=14)
            defect_entries[qq] = def_entry
            plot_data[qq] = frey_summary.metadata["plot_data"]
        return defect_entries, plot_data
    defect_entries_dict, _ = load_defect_entries_and_plot_data(Path(correct path))
    defect_entries = list(defect_entries_dict.values())
    for g_name, g in group_defect_entries(defect_entries=defect_entries):
        [MASK] # Replace [MASK] with the correct code to obtain the desired properties.
    ```

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generate data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.core import Structure`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
