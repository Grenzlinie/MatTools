As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties for an interstitial defect in a GaN structure:
    - `oxidation_state`: The oxidation state of the interstitial defect site in the variable inter. (int)
    - `charge_states`: Possible charge states for the interstitial defect in the variable inter. (list)
    - `fractional_coordinates`: Fractional coordinates of the interstitial defect site within the lattice. (list)
    - `supercell_formula`: Chemical formula of the supercell containing the interstitial defect. (str)
    - `defect_name`: Name of the interstitial defect, indicating the element and type of defect. (str)
    - `defect_string_representation`: String representation of the interstitial defect, including its position. (str)
    - `element_changes`: Changes in the number of elements due to the interstitial defect. (dict)
    - `latex_name`: LaTeX formatted name of the interstitial defect. (str)
    - `defect_fpos_initial`: Fractional coordinates of the defect site in the supercell structure using DefectSiteFinder. (list)
    - `defect_fpos_modified`: Fractional coordinates of the defect site in the modified supercell structure. Target fractional coordinate used in supercell generating is [0.3, 0.5, 0.9]. (list)
    - `user_defined_charge_states`: User-defined charge states for the interstitial defect. The charge defined for the interstitial defect is [-100, 102]. You need to use Pymatgen's method to assign values to the corresponding property parameters in the variable inter2, and then use Interstitial's method to print this value. (list)

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/GaN.vasp`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.core import Structure
    gan_struct = Structure.from_file(file_path / "GaN.vasp")
    ```
    - Generate an interstitial defect using Pymatgen:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.core import Interstitial, PeriodicSite
    from pymatgen.core.periodic_table import Specie
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.finder import DefectSiteFinder
    s = gan_struct.copy()
    inter_fpos = [0, 0, 0.75]
    n_site = PeriodicSite(Specie("N"), inter_fpos, s.lattice)
    inter = Interstitial(s, n_site)
    finder = DefectSiteFinder()
    inter2 = Interstitial(s, n_site)
    ```

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generate data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.core import Structure`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
