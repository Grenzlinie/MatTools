As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `wswq_slope_positive_distortion`: The slope of the WSWQ data when the distortion values are positive, indicating a change in the material's electronic structure. The format is a numpy array.
    - `wswq_slope_negative_distortion`: The slope of the WSWQ data when the distortion values are negative, reflecting a different change in the material's electronic structure. The format is a numpy array.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Generate fake WSWQ data using numpy arrays for testing purposes. You should use the following code snippet:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from collections import namedtuple
    def _get_wswq_slope(distortions: list[float], wswqs: list[WSWQ]) -> npt.NDArray:
        """Get the slopes of the overlap matrixs vs. Q.

        Args:
            distortions: List of Q values (amu^{1/2} Angstrom).
            wswqs: List of WSWQ objects. The WSWQ file is used to calculation the wave function overlaps between:
            - W: Wavefunctions in the current directory's WAVECAR file.
            - WQ: Wavefunctions stored in the WAVECAR.qqq file.

        Returns:
            npt.NDArray: slope matrix with the same shape as the ``WSWQ.data``.
                Since there is always ambiguity in the phase, we require that the output
                is always positive.
        """
        yy = np.stack([np.abs(ww.data) * np.sign(qq) for qq, ww in zip(distortions, wswqs)])
        _, *oldshape = yy.shape
        return np.polyfit(distortions, yy.reshape(yy.shape[0], -1), deg=1)[0].reshape(
            *oldshape,
        )
    # Make sure the the slope is automatically defined as the sign of the distoration changes.
    mats = [np.ones((3, 5)), np.zeros((3, 5)), np.ones((3, 5))]
    FakeWSWQ = namedtuple("FakeWSWQ", ["data"])
    fake_wswqs = [FakeWSWQ(data=m) for m in mats]
    distorations1 = [-0.5, 0, 0.5]
    distorations2 = [1.0, 0, -1.0]
    ```

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Generates the fake WSWQ data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `import numpy as np`).
    - Proper data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
