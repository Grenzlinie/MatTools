As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `defect_grouping_without_key_function`: The grouping of defects based on their structure without using a key function, ensuring that defects at inequivalent sites are grouped separately. The format is a string.
    - `defect_grouping_with_key_function`: The grouping of defects based on both their structure and name using a key function, ensuring that defects are grouped correctly by both criteria. The format is a string.
    - `group_names_with_key_function`: The names of groups formed when defects are grouped by both structure and name using a key function. The format is a string.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function to get GaN crystal structure:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.core import Structure
    gan_struct = Structure.from_file(file_path / "GaN.vasp")
    ```
    - Generate defects and group them using the following Pymatgen methods:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.core import Interstitial, PeriodicSite, Vacancy
    from pymatgen.analysis.structure_matcher import StructureMatcher
    from pymatgen.core.periodic_table import Specie
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.utils import [MASK]

    s = gan_struct.copy()
    vac1 = Vacancy(s, s.sites[0])
    vac2 = Vacancy(s, s.sites[1])
    vac3 = Vacancy(s, s.sites[2])
    vac4 = Vacancy(s, s.sites[3])

    def get_interstitial(fpos):
        n_site = PeriodicSite(Specie("N"), fpos, s.lattice)
        return Interstitial(s, n_site)
    # two interstitials are at inequivalent sites so should be in different groups
    int1 = get_interstitial([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
    int2 = get_interstitial([0.0, 0.0, 0.25])
    sm = StructureMatcher()
    # Ensure that the grouping works without a key function (only structure)
    sgroups = [MASK](
        [vac1, vac2, int1, vac3, vac4, int2],
        sm,
        lambda x: x.defect_structure,
    )
    res = []
    for _, group in sgroups:
        defect_names = ",".join([x.name for x in group])
        res.append(defect_names)
    defect_grouping_without_key_function = "|".join(sorted(res))
    sgroups = [MASK](
        [vac1, vac2, int1, vac3, vac4, int1, int2],
        sm,
        lambda x: x.defect_structure,
        lambda x: x.name,
    )
    res = []
    g_names = []
    for name, group in sgroups:
        defect_names = ",".join([x.name for x in group])
        g_names.append(name)
        res.append(defect_names)
    defect_grouping_with_key_function = "|".join(sorted([MASK]))
    group_names_with_key_function = "|".join(sorted([MASK]))
    ```
    # Replace [MASK] with correct pymatgen function or defined variables to get results.

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generates data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.core import Structure`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
