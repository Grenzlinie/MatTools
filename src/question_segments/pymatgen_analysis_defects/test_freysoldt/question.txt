As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `freysoldt_correction_energy`: The correction energy calculated using the Freysoldt method, which accounts for electrostatic interactions in charged defects within a periodic lattice. The format should be a float.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the data path for Mg_Ga at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/Mg_Ga`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function to read the data:
    ```python
    from collections import defaultdict
    from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Locpot, Vasprun
    from pathlib import Path

    def get_data_Mg_Ga():
        root_dir = Path("tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/Mg_Ga")
        data = defaultdict(dict)
        for fold in root_dir.glob("./*"):
            if not fold.is_dir():
                continue
            data[fold.name] = {
                "vasprun": Vasprun(fold / "vasprun.xml.gz"),
                "locpot": Locpot.from_file(fold / "LOCPOT.gz"),
            }
        return data
    data_Mg_Ga = get_data_Mg_Ga()
    bulk_locpot = data_Mg_Ga["bulk_sc"]["locpot"]
    defect_locpot = data_Mg_Ga["q=0"]["locpot"]
    freysoldt_summary = get_freysoldt_correction(
        q=0,
        dielectric=14,
        defect_locpot=defect_locpot,
        bulk_locpot=bulk_locpot,
        defect_frac_coords=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
    )
    freysoldt_correction_energy = freysoldt_summary.[MASK] # replace [MASK] with correct variable to get the correction energy.
    ```

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generates data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.analysis.defects.corrections.freysoldt import get_freysoldt_correction`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
