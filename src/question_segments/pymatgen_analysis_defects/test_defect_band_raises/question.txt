As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `defect_band_index_mismatch`: Checks if a ValueError is raised when the defect band indices are mismatched. The format is a string "Raises ValueError" indicating if the ValueError is raised.
    - `defect_spin_index_mismatch`: Checks if a ValueError is raised when the defect spin indices are mismatched. The format is a string "Raises ValueError" indicating if the ValueError is raised.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the directory containing VASP output files path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/v_Ga/ccd_0_-1`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function to read the VASP run data and PROCAR file:
      ```python
      from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Vasprun, Procar
      vaspruns = [Vasprun(file_path / f"{i}/vasprun.xml") for i in [0, 1, 2]]
      procar = Procar(file_path / "1/PROCAR")
      ```
    - Create a `HarmonicDefect` object and defect bands using:
      ```python
      from pymatgen.analysis.defects.ccd import HarmonicDefect
      hd0 = HarmonicDefect.from_vaspruns(vaspruns, charge_state=0, procar=procar, store_bandstructure=True)
      # mis-matched defect band
      hd0.defect_band = [(138, 0, 1), (139, 1, 1)]
      [MASK] # If an error is triggered, assign the value 'Raises ValueError' to 'defict_mand_index_ismatch'.
      # mis-matched defect spin
      hd0.defect_band = [(138, 0, 1), (138, 1, 0)]
      [MASK] # If an error is triggered, assign the value 'Raises ValueError' to 'defect_spin_index_mismatch'.
      ```
      and replace [MASK] with pymatgen code that triggers corresponding errors to calculate the properties.

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generates data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that:
	•	If a calculation raises a ValueError, the corresponding property value is set to 'Raises ValueError'.
	•	For other errors or by default, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.io.vasp.outputs import Vasprun, Procar`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
