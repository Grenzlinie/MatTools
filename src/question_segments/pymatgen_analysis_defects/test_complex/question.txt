As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `defect_complex_name`: The name of the defect complex, indicating the types of defects present. Format: str.
    - `supercell_structure_formula`: The chemical formula of the supercell structure after introducing the defect complex. Format: str.
    - `defect_complex_oxidation_state`: Checks if the total oxidation state of the defect complex is equal to the number calculated as the sum of the oxidation states of substitution defect and vacancy defect. Format: bool.
    - `element_changes`: The net change in the number of each element due to the defect complex. Format: dict.
    - `defect_structure_formula`: The chemical formula of the defect structure itself, without considering the supercell. Format: str.
    - `defect_complex_with_interstitial_name`: The name of the defect complex including an interstitial defect. Format: str.
    - `supercell_structure_with_dummy_formula`: The chemical formula of the supercell structure with a dummy species added to account for the interstitial defect. The dummy species is Xe. Format: str.
    - `defect_complex_equality`: Checks if the defect complex object is equal to itself. Uses variable dc2 as the defect complex. Format: bool.
    - `defect_complex_inequality`: Checks if two defect complexes are different. Uses variable dc and dc2 as the two defect complexes. Format: bool.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Access the structure file path at: `tool_source_code/pymatgen-analysis-defects/tests/test_files/GaN.vasp`.
    - Use the Pymatgen function:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.core import Structure
    gan_struct = Structure.from_file(file_path)
    ```
    - Generate defect complexes using Pymatgen:
    ```python
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.core import PeriodicSite, Substitution, Vacancy, Interstitial, DefectComplex
    from pymatgen.core.periodic_table import Specie, Element

    s = gan_struct.copy()
    o_site = PeriodicSite(Specie("O"), s[3].frac_coords, s.lattice)
    sub = Substitution(s, o_site)  # O substituted on N site
    vac = Vacancy(s, s.sites[0])  # Ga vacancy
    inter = Interstitial(s, PeriodicSite(Specie("H"), [0, 0, 0.75], s.lattice))  # H interstitial
    dc = DefectComplex([sub, vac])
    dc2 = DefectComplex([sub, vac, inter])
    ```

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Reads the data from the provided file paths or generate data based on the description in the first section.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property names are keys, and the calculated results are the values.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.core import Structure`).
    - Proper file handling or data generation code.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with clear input parameters, data types, and a description of the output.
