As a materials scientist, you are utilizing Pymatgen to write functions to calculate material properties. Here is what you need to do:
- Calculate the following properties:
    - `Radiative_Coefficient`: Calculates the radiative recombination coefficient based on temperature, dipole moment, and other parameters. The format should be a list of float values.

If you need to read files or generate data, please refer to the following instructions:
- Read or Generate Data:
    - Use the Pymatgen function 
    ```python
    from pymatgen.analysis.defects.recombination import [MASK]
    Radiative_Coefficient = [MASK](
        T=[100, 200, 300],
        dQ=1.0,
        dE=1.0,
        omega_i=0.2,
        omega_f=0.2,
        omega_photon=0.6,
        dipole_me=1,
        volume=1,
        g=1,
    )
    ``` to calculate the radiative recombination coefficient. Replace [MASK] with correct pymatgen function to get the result.

All content is executed within the function, and the function does not require any input to output the result. The format of the function should follow these guidelines:
- Write a Python function that:
    - Uses the provided parameters to calculate the radiative recombination coefficient using Pymatgen.
    - Calculates all the properties mentioned above using Pymatgen, as well as basic Python methods or functions.
    - Returns a dictionary where the property name is the key, and the calculated result is the value.
    - Handles errors during property calculations such that if any property calculation fails, the corresponding property value is set to None, while other properties are still calculated and included in the output.

- Ensure your function includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `from pymatgen.analysis.defects.recombination import get_Rad_coef`).
    - Calculation code using the provided parameters.
    - Output in the form of a dictionary as specified above.
    - A complete docstring with a description of the output.
