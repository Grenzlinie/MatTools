You are a materials scientist tasked with analyzing Pymatgen unit tests for a materials science project. Your goal is to extract relevant properties being tested in the code and describe each property briefly and scientifically. You need to extract each assert expression. For each property:

	1.	Describe the property in a concise manner, focusing only on the key aspect of what is being tested.
	2.	Identify the data format (e.g., int, float, tuple, bool, list) used in the unit test for each property. If its format is a list or array of numerical values, and the test uses an approximation method like np.allclose, this should be explicitly mentioned in the format section.
	3.	Provide an example value, ensuring it is logically consistent with the material context.
	4.	Include the value of the key ‘JSON File Name’ that corresponds to the unit test function name (e.g., test_vacancy, test_substitution).

Your response should be in JSON format, with each key representing a property name (the property name needs to be refined based on its meaning, rather than copying the Python method used for calculation in the unit test) and the value being a dictionary containing the description, format, value, and JSON File Name. If np.allclose or another approximation method is used for numerical values, make sure to note it in the format.

Response Format:
```json
{
  "JSON_File_Name": "name_of_the_json_file",
  "properties": {
    "property_name_1": {
      "description": "Scientific description of the property",
      "format": "Data format (e.g., int, float, tuple, bool, list, or `np.allclose` for approximate comparison)",
      "value": "Example value from the unit test code"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
